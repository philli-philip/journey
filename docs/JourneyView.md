# Journey View

This document should describe the journey view.

Each User journey generally has two parts. The first is the journey steps and the 2nd are the metadate directly linked to the journey. The steps take up the majority of the view while the metadata takes up the rest.

## Metadata

Title should be at the top of the page. Metadata can be accessed via a side panel. The metadata can be displayed in a key-value pair form. Except the description wich is just stand alone.

## Steps

The steps are horizontally displayed. Each steps is similar to a kanban column. The steps can be moved around and reordered (not for MVP).
Each step columnn is divided into serveral cells. The cells are:

- Name: A unique name for the step.
- Description: A detailed description of the step. short support Markdown
- Dimensions: A list of dimensions for the step.

Overall the Steps view forms a grid, with each step being a column and every dimension being a row. The dimension rows should be collapsable at the user's discretion.
